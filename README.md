## auth contract

### Login 

Overview
The login function is responsible for authenticating a user based on their address. If the user does not exist, it will register the user and return a success message. If the user already exists, it will simply return a success message.

#### Function Signature

```
(define-public (login (user-address principal) (user-picture (string-utf8 256)))
```

Parameters
- user-address (principal): The unique address of the user attempting to log in. This is a required parameter.
- user-picture (string-utf8 256): The picture associated with the user. This is also a required parameter and is used for registration if the user does not exist.

Returns

- Success: If the user exists or is successfully registered, the function returns:
ok "Login successful": A success message indicating that the login was successful.
- Error: If the user does not exist and registration fails, the function returns:
err ERR_USER_ALREADY_EXISTS: An error indicating that the user already exists (this should not occur in normal operation since the existence is checked before registration).


### Get user data

Overview
The get-user-data function retrieves the data associated with a specific user based on their address. It checks if the user exists in the system and returns the corresponding user data or an error if the user does not exist.

#### Function Signature

```
(define-read-only (get-user-data (user-address principal))
```

Parameters
- user-address (principal): The unique address of the user whose data is being requested. This is a required parameter.

Returns
- Success: If the user exists, the function returns:
- ok user-data: The user data associated with the provided address, which includes details such as the user's picture and address.
- Error: If the user does not exist, the function returns:
- err ERR_USER_NOT_EXIST: An error indicating that the user does not exist in the system.
